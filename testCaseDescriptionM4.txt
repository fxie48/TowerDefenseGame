This file explains M4 test cases


Sharon
monumentHealthIsEqualTo1000() 
* This will test whether the monument health is initialized to 1000
* This makes sure that the monument always shows up with the same health

monumentXIsEqualTo1712()
* This will test whether the monument is initialized to 1712 for its x coordinate
* This makes sure that the monument always shows up at the same location on the map

Neo
speedofFlameEnemyIsEqualto10()
* This will test the initial characteristics of the Flame Enemy. 
* It tests whether the Flame Enemy’s speed is initially set to 10.

monumentYIsEqualTo150()
* This will test the initial y-coordinate of the monument on the map. 
* It test whether the monument’s y-coordinate is set to 150.

Jason
speedOfNinjaEnemyIsEqualTo20()
* This test case checks if the ninja has 20 speed unit. It is important to check the speed of Ninja
because the speed will be changed in the future implementation, so the initial speed would be measured.

speedOfSpiritEnemyIsEqualTo5()
* This test case checks if the spirit has 5 speed unit. It is important to check the speed of Spirit
because the speed will be different than the original speed in the future implementation, hence the initial speed need to be measured.

Felice
yOfNinjaEnemyIsEqualTo750()
* This test checks if ninja starts with a y-coordinate of 750

yOfFlameEnemyIsEqualTo750()
* This test checks if flame starts with a y-coordinate of 750

Harrison
yOfSpiritEnemyIsEqualTo20
* this test case checks if spirit starts with a y coordinate of 750

ninjaSpeedCanBeChanged
* this test checks if the ninja's speed can be changed
* the test helps the ninja's speed is controlled by the magic tower which the team implement on the next milestone.
